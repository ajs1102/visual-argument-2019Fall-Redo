For my visual argument so far, I have created two separate concepts to create a juxtapostion for my image. At the top I tried to create a fantasy setting,
using an image of a dragon in front of a mountain. At the bottom I wanted to ground the image in the reality of D&D by creating a pile of
dice at the bottom.

The most difficult part of this argument so far was coloring in the image of the dragon, since the best image I found was only a black and white picture.

For my next steps, I plan on expanding the fantasy section of my image by hopefully adding an image of a castle in the background.
I also plan on adding text to explicitly make an argument for joining the campaign.

One thing I'm not sure about is how to change the background to create a smooth transition between the fantasy setting and the bottom border of dice.
I was thinking of maybe setting the background color to a gradient, starting with a sky color at the top, and transitioning to a more neutral color
towards the bottom.

Another aspect of D&D that I would like to incorporate into my argument is the silliness that is often involved in the storytelling.
This will be more difficult though as blending that with the more serious atmosphere of the dragon imagery.

The last part of my argument that I'm not sure about is the specific text I should use for my central message. I was thinking of something
along the lines of "D&D: Join the adventure" with general contact information below that. I'm not sure that I'm absolutely happy with that
particular message, but I will see how it works when I add the text.
